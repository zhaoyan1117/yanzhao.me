description: |
    This project along is part of my final project for CS184-Computer Graphics at Berkeley. We implemented a physical based simulator for cloth using finite element methods; we have also serialized the output of our cloth simulator into a <a href="/project/ray_tracer/">global illumination renderer</a> we created.
