My name is Yan Zhao. I am currently a junior at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) studying [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu). I am originally from China and have spent my first 17 years in this beautiful north eastern city - [Changchun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changchun).

In the academic field, I am interested in [Computer Graphics][CG], [High-performance Computing][HPC], and [SaaS Development][SaaS].

With many backend experiences in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), I am building my skills in front-end development and working on my way to become a full-stack engineer. <a class="about_linkedin icon-linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/yan-zhao/65/1a8/8a4"></a>

In my spare time (though very little), I would like to explore in the [culinary](/culinary) world, especially traditional Chinese food.

If you are interested in my work and want to learn more, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:zhaoyan1117@gmail.com). Or if you want to take a look at my resume, please [contact][resume_request] me and I will get back to you.
